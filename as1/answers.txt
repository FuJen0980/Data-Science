1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
Pandas were easier to use due to the result being much more organized and easier to read. For code, I found both libraries to be around the same readability-wise as both used relatively the same syntax and parameters with the function name to be a little different but still very easy to understand. 

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
For the function pivot_months_pandas the time was 20.8ms while for the pivot_months_loops the time was 463ms. The difference in time could be attributed to pandas being optimized and written in C/Cython rather than python overhead function. One other thing is pandas being able to apply the function on all the rows at once rather than iterating through like the pivot_months_loops function.
